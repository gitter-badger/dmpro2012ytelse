\section {Macaos}

(TODO: This section is intended to provide a few insights about the
ins and outs of using Macaos for creating production-files, some of
what ends up here MAY fit better in an Appendix, but we feel it might
be usefull to note down what we learned for those that come after us)

\begin {enumerate}
\item Visit the Macaos homepage and apply for a license-key (TODO: Insert url)
\item In Altium Designer, use File-Fabrication Outputs-Gerber Files
\item In Altium Designer, use File-Fabrication Outputs-NC Drill Files
\item The necessary files should now exist in your Project-folder under "Project Outputs for Projectname"
\item Install and open Macaos
\item (TODO: Complete this when I have access to a computer with Macaos on.)
\end {enumerate}
