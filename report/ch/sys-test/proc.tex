\section{Test Procedures}

Some of these tests are strictly dependent on other\TODO{Other what?}. In theory, all the
different tests could be done in any order to test the correctness of the
system. However, some of the functional requirements makes it easy to test other
functional requirements. Therefore, we have decided to let some of these tests
have dependencies. In addition, their ordering is a natural way to approach and
test such a system, mostly because some of the test have a slight overlap. For
instance, it is easier to have example programs if the assembler works
correctly.

{\sc Test 1 - Functional Requirement 5}

{\em \FRV}
Write an AVR program to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Activate LEDs
\item Wait a while
\item Deactivate leds
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 2 - Functional Requirement 4}

{\em \FRIV}
Write an AVR program to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set up button interrupts
\item Flips led X when button X is pressed
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 3 - Functional Requirement 6}

{\em \FRVI}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 4 - Functional Requirement 3}

{\em \FRIII}
Write an AVR program to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load the LENA with a program that just copies an image out to the VGA
\item Read an image from the SD card
\item Load the image onto the LENA
\item Start the LENA
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 5 - Functional Requirement 7}

{\em \FRVII}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 6 - Functional Requirement 1}

{\em \FRI}
Write and AVR program to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load the LENA with a program that copies images out to the VGA as they are loaded
\item Read an image from the SD card
\item Load the image onto the LENA
\item Start the LENA
\item repeat 2-4 until out of pictures
\item measure speed.
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 7 - Functional Requirement 2}

{\em \FRII}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}
