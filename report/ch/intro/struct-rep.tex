\section{Structure of the Report}

This report may be viewed as divided into three parts: chapters
\ref{ch:intro}, \ref{ch:sys-over}-\ref{ch:pcb} and
\ref{ch:sys-test}-\ref{ch:conc}. The
current chapter gives an introduction to the assignment and our goals.
% and our team. \CHECK{Is the background chapter included?}
% Chapter \ref{ch:back} contains relevant background information for
% reading the rest of the report.

Chapters \ref{ch:sys-over} to \ref{ch:pcb} explains in deeper detail {\em how}
the machine works. Chapter \ref{ch:sys-over} gives an overview of the whole
machine and how the different parts are connected together. Chapter
\ref{ch:fpga} elaborates on the \ac{LENA} Architecture, which is the \ac{FPGA}
design of the machine. \ac{SIMD} nodes, control core as well as the \ac{FPGA}
\ac{VGA} module is explained in detail, along with the interconnection between
these. Chapter \ref{ch:avr} describes the software and structures for the \ac{SCU},
such as the file format and the program and data menu. Chapter \ref{ch:pcb}
explains the work with designing the \ac{PCB}, as well as the soldering and
other workarounds we had to do.

Chapters \ref{ch:sys-test} to \ref{ch:conc} is the conclusion part of the
report. Here we test the machine, discuss our choices and present our
conclusion, as well as possible further work. Chapter \ref{ch:sys-test} contains
tests to check whether we have managed to reach our requirements or not, along
with their results. Chapter \ref{ch:res} describes the result, performance and
energy consumption of the machine with different cores and different
programs. Chapter \ref{ch:disc} discusses different choices we made in our
project, and the consequences of these. In chapter \ref{ch:conc}, our conclusion is
given along with pointers to further work.
