\section {Hardware}

As we decided to use many of the same solutions as previous years, we naturally
decided to use many of the same components as they were proven to
work. Following the same logic, some of our solutions are more or less a copy of
previous years, such as the power supply. This is because we were heavily
advised to use working solutions if we found any. We always
tried to double check and find out how they worked before creating a new part in
our system. As for the serial, a lot of sources on the internet disagreed with
Festina Lente's design. Therefore we chose to do this differently from Festina Lente.
The precise reason why our serial is dysfunctional was not uncovered, so whether we
should have followed Festina Lente instead or not is hard to say.
