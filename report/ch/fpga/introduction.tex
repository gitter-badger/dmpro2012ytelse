\section{Introduction}

We have named our processor \acs{LENA} (\acl{LENA}) and it is implemented on the
\ac{FPGA}. Its main components are a \ac{SIMD} array consisting of 4 cores, a
control module to manage the data, and a \ac{VGA} controller. \ac{LENA} is
responsible for receiving data from the AVR, processing it and sending the
output to the \ac{VGA} port.
