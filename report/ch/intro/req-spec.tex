\section{Requirements Specification}

\input{fig/intro/func} A few functional
and most non-functional requirements were given to us by our instructor, Magnus
Jahre. The rest were decided by the group as goals we thought were realizable, and
some to help us see how far away we are from our goals. Table
\ref{fig:func-req}, which shows the functional requirements, includes a relative
priority between the different requirements.  This priority tells us what we
have focused on, as well as what is important in terms of success of the
computer. Clearly, focusing on performance, as specified in {\sc FR1}, is more
important than having developer tools for the machine ({\sc FR6}).

{\sc FR1} ensures a focus on performance. {\sc FR2} ensures that we do not end
up with a system which is not generally programmable. This is important, as a
computer specialized for image processing has less usability than a generally
programmable computer. {\sc FR3} and {\sc FR7} makes it easier to show that the
computer is capable of processing images, whereas {\sc FR4 - FR6} makes it
easier to use, debug and create programs for the computer.

\input{fig/intro/nonfunc}

Table \ref{fig:nonfunc-req} shows the non-functional requirements. These were
all determined by the assignment. They are all treated as absolute requirements,
and our design has been centered around those. {\sc NFR1} and {\sc NFR2} gave us
little choice in what hardware to use, and naturally these have been used. {\sc
  NFR3} limits what components we can use to cheaper ones. {\sc NFR4} Constraints our
design choices when designing the image processor. We could not make any type of core
organization, we have to make this specific type. {\sc NFR5} leads to some
design choices for the entire system. Our goal is performance, and we do not
have to care about other concerns such as energy consumption, just to
get performance as good as possible without the system
burning up. However, we may have to sacrifice some simplicity in our design for
the sake of performance.
