\chapter{System Testing}\label{ch:sys-test}

\begin{flushright}{\slshape
    In which a set of tests are designed,\\
    carefully and ingeniously to confirm or reject\\
    the functional requirements we have designed
}
\end{flushright}

Any system with functional requirements needs to verify whether the functional
requirements are satisfied or not. This is done through system tests, which are
essential to get a confirmation or a rejection on whether we satisfy the
requirements. Usually will test the functionality of a system as a whole, but
the nature of our requirements\TODO{Are they really like this?} means that some
of the tests will only test specific parts of the system. 

This chapter will start by presenting the design of the system tests. It will
then go into how we will test the different tests. We summarize by presenting
our results with additional comments.
