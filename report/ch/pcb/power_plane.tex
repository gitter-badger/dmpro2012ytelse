\section {Power Plane}

\input{fig/pcb/power_planes}

Since our power supply was exactly the same as Festina Lente's we also ended up
with similar power planes, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:power_planes}; 12V (dark blue), 5V (teal), 
3.3V (red), 2.5V (gray) and 1.2V (green). The 5V was only used for the external 
\ac{VGA} module. 2.5V and 1.2V were split across the \ac{FPGA}.

The rest of the board got 3.3V. The entire power plane was put in internal layer
1, with a ground layer in internal layer 2.
