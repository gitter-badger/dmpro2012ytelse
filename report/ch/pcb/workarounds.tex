\section {Problems and Workarounds}
\subsection{Routing}
Routing was the first problem we confronted during the designing the \ac{PCB}
board, we had to manually route the design, because we got some warnings due to
the clearance of the board. We used the auto-routing function provided by
Altium, yet as it did not privode satisfying results, we tried to change some
parameters to make them better, without success. Finally, we realized that we
had to route a few wires manually. This was mostly motivated by our desire to
not have vias as close to the pins as Altium placed them. Also, as to cut down
the bugdet, we removed some unnecessary vias by wiring multiple grounds and
powers together, where the design allowed us to. In this way, we got quite a few
less vias.
\subsection{Soldering}
Soldering was the bigest problem that we faced, none of the \ac{PCB} group
member had any experiences with it beforehand. We managed to destroy our first
board, as we used too much tin on one of the AVR pins, and ruined them by using
the tin removal unit wrongly.

The next try, however, proved to be successful, but there still remained some
minor problems. Problems we found were lack of tin on the oscillator, as well as
a few of the \ac{FPGA} pins. They were, as opposed to our problem with the first
board, easily fixed, once discoverred.
