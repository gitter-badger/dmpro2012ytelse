\subsection{Soldering}
After about a days work we managed to completely destroy a pin on the AVR,
therefore we had to start soldering a new board. On this new board we
started soldering the AVR and \ac{FPGA}, as they were the hardest components to
solder on the first board. After soldering each side on the AVR and \ac{FPGA}, 
we tested the board for short circuits. As no short circuits were found, 
we moved on to soldering the power supply, as well as the \acp{JTAG}, FLASH 
and \acp{LED}. In order to check that the \ac{PCB} was working, the
AVR and \ac{FPGA} groups tested the \ac{PCB} without the capacitors. 
After both groups had tested that they could connect to the AVR and \ac{FPGA}
respectively, we soldered the rest of the \ac{PCB}.
