\section {Dispostition}
- requirements avr, fpga
- fpga ready footprint
- how did we get avr footprint?
- layers
- all in one schematic, no parallelization
- redundance, examples
- simple, examples (toplevel, chapter 1?)
- headers
- footprints and schematics
- tests, during soldering,

for every part (schematic section, footprint) etc
    - references, datasheets
    - differences from last year
    - diffictulties
    - pictures, in text of refer to figure id something something
    - schematic section/part

    - some sentences about using the macaos tool
    - time usage
    - week routing, compare to other group
    - one memory chis vs 5
    - soldering insights
    - two vgas (top level design?)
    - memory choice, why, explain 2*16-8 bit (is this PCB or "system"?)
    - autorouting + manual via removal
    - find physical proximity
    - accidentally forgot one pin in schematic during reordering
    - could have used other auto-route settings
    - think physical prox when throughout all the planning, at least pin "budget"
    - Lena on top overlay, how, edge detection ++, ALtium Delphi-script
    - problems with oscillator, (despite not mirrored footprint like last year)

    - buses, net-label, unique names

    - memory chip design, why so many, why 2 instr mem chips?
    - 24 bit chips out of production
    - 32 bits too expensive


    part list:
    - capacitors, resistors (why, which)
    - 1206, copy from last years success
    - avr
    - voltage regulator area, cribbing with Gunnar's and Magnus' blessing
    - power plane
    - usb
    - serial
    - sd card
    - avr memory, vga memory, data memory,
    - avr vga, fpga vga
    - group communication?

    - via sizes, 0.71mm?

    lots and lots of referces and source citations


    Appendiks:
    - Pin "usage"
    - Schemetics, overview + sections (mspaint-PNG? vector graphics?)
    - ask other group about vector graphics (they used for logo)
        - pictures of PCB
        - footprints
