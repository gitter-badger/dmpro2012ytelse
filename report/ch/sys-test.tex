    If you donâ€™t care about quality, you can meet any other requirement.\\ \medskip

Any system with functional requirements needs to verify whether the functional
requirements are satisfied or not. This is done through system tests, which are
essential to get a confirmation or a rejection of whether we satisfy the
requirements. Usually we will test the functionality of a system as a whole, but
the nature of our requirements means that some of the tests will only test
specific parts of the system.

This chapter will start by presenting the design of the system tests. It will
then go into how we will test the different tests\TODO{Man tester ikke tester, man tester krav}. We summarize by presenting
our results with additional comments.
