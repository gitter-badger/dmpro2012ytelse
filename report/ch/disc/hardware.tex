\section {Hardware}

As we decided to use many of the same solutions as privious years, we also decided to use many of the same components, as they were proven to work. Following the same logic, some of our solutions are more or less a copy of privious years, such as the power supply. This is because we were heavily advised to use working solutions if we found them, as the instance with the power supply, which was "worked on and perfected over multiple years" as Tufte said. We always tried to double check and find out how they worked before creating a new part in our system. When we came to the serial, our multiple sources seemingly disagreed with how festina lente had theirs. We chose to do it the other way, which turned out to not work quite as well as we hoped.
\TODO {Find out whether serial works or not}
