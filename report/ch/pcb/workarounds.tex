\section {Problems and Workarounds}
\subsection{Routing}
Routing was the first problem we confronted during the designing the \ac{PCB}
board, we had to manually route the design, because we got some warnings due to
the clearance of the board. We used the auto-routing function provided by
Altium, yet as it did not provide satisfying results, we tried to change some
parameters to make them better, without success. Finally, we realized that we
had to route a few wires manually. This was mostly motivated by our desire to
not have vias as close to the pins as Altium placed them. Also, as to cut down
the budget, we removed some unnecessary vias by wiring multiple grounds and
powers together, where the design allowed us to. In this way, we got quite a few
less vias.

We spent the entire final week before production working on the routing. In comparison, the energy group used only 2 days. There are quite a few possible reasons why we ended up using so much more time than them for this:

One of the reasons were simply that we were the first group to start routing. We thus had no one to warn us about mistakes. An example of such a mistake was that we did not set the correct Design Rules before auto-routing, until a few days into the week. This naturally did not give us the routing that we wanted, and gave us a few headaches.

Related to this is the fact that we did not experiment enough with different routing strategies.

Another reason relates to the difference between our designs. Where the other group had to route only 1 memory chip, we had 5. This naturally made the routing much more complex.
\subsection{Soldering}
Soldering was the biggest problem that we faced, none of the \ac{PCB} group
member had any experiences with it beforehand. We managed to destroy our first
board, as we used too much tin on one of the AVR pins, and ruined them by using
the tin removal unit wrongly.

The next try, however, proved to be successful, but there still remained some
minor problems. Problems we found were lack of tin on the oscillator, as well as
a few of the \ac{FPGA} pins. They were, as opposed to our problem with the first
board, easily fixed, once discovered.
