\section {Power plane}

Since our power supply was exactly the same as Festina Lente's we also ended up
with similar power planes; 12V, 5V, 3.3V, 2.5V and 1.2V. The 5V was only used
for the external VGA-controller. 2.5V and 1.2V were split across the FPGA.

The rest of the board got 3.3V. The entire power plane was put in internal layer
1, with a ground layer in internal layer 2.
