The entire system is connected together on the PCB. Designing and soldering
a correct and working PCB is thus important to be able to construct the system
as a whole.

This chapter will start by explaining how some of our overall design choices
affected the PCB design. We elaborate our power layout before giving an
overview of where we got our footprints from. Finally, we explain the process 
of making the PCB, as well as some of the issues and solutions we met during 
the process.
