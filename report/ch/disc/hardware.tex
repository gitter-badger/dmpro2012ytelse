\section {Hardware}

As we decided to use many of the same solutions as previous years, we naturally
decided to use many of the same components, as they were proven to
work. Following the same logic, some of our solutions are more or less a copy of
previous years, such as the power supply. This is because we were heavily
advised to use working solutions if we found any. We always
tried to double check and find out how they worked before creating a new part in
our system. This proved to work well, and we had no problems in the parts of our
system that we reused from last year. Our only design problem in the hardware was
when we managed to use a footprint for the serial which had the opposite gender
of our pin mapping.
