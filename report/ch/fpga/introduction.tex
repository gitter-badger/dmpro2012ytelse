\section{Introduction}

We have named our image processor \acs{LENA} (\acl{LENA}). Its main
components are a \ac{SIMD} array consisting of 6 cores, a control module
to manage the data, and a \ac{VGA} controller. \ac{LENA} is responsible
for receiving data from the AVR, processing it and sending the output to
the \ac{VGA} port.

LENA is implemented on a Xilinx Spartan-3E XC3S500E PQG208 FPGA. The
FPGA uses a clock rate of 50 MHz for the VGA memory controller and 25
MHz for the VGA signal generator and the processor cores.

The first section in this chapter gives an overview of the image
processor architecture. The following sections describe the SIMD array,
the control module and the VGA controller in further detail.
