\section {Footprints}
Some of the components we chose did not have footprints readily available, which
meant we either had to look for them on the internet, or create some ourselves.

This usually meant either staring at datasheets and carefully placing pins
relative to each other, or running the IPC wizard.

\subsection{We made the following footprints ourselves}
\input{fig/pcb/footprintswemade}
\begin{description}
\item[SD card] With the pin-designations selected by googling the pinouts for
  \ac{SD} cards in general, and comparing a few of those hits to make sure that
  the results agreed
  this\footnote{\url{http://pinouts.ru/Memory/sdcard_pinout.shtml}} ended up
  being what we based the schematic-component based on. This
  schematic\footnote{\url{http://katalog.we-online.de/em/datasheet/693063010911.pdf}}
  schematic was particularly hard to read, to the point that we had to ask Tufte
  for help to understand it, and even after that, there was no way to be sure
  precisely where the grounding pads were relative to the rest of the \ac{SD}
  card reader. We thus ended up with a bit of guesswork, and added quite a bit
  of slack to the ground-pads by simply adding extra tin to these pads.
\item[Memory (TSOP54/TSOP44)] The TSOP54/TSOP44 footprints were created using
  the IPC Footprint Wizard, as their datasheets fitted nicely with the Small
  Outline Package setting in that Wizard.
\end{description}

\subsection{Footprints from other sources:}
As Festina Lente used some components that we also ended up using, we decided,
after talking to Tufte, to use their Footprints\footnote{\url{http://org.ntnu.no/datamaskinerprosjekt2011/altium_libraries/dmprolibrary/}}
(as they were known to work) for these components:

\input{fig/pcb/footprintsources}
The oscillator had one issue last year, namely that the
footprint was mirrored, noting this from Festina Lente's report, we read
through the datasheet, and remapped the pin-numbering on the foot-print 
before using this footprint.

After reading the Festina Lente report\cite{berg2011festinalente}, we decided to
follow their choice of footprint for capacitors and resistors: 1206 SMT. As
those were physically bigger than the 0804 SMTs they mentioned as an
alternative, they would be easier to solder by hand.
