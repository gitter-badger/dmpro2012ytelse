\section {Power supply}

After talking to Gunnar and Magnus, we ended up with cribbing the power supply from
Festina Lente completely, with no changes, as Gunnar said the power supply had
evolved year by year, and would thus be a better solution than trying to
create one from scratch ourselves (reducing the possibility for additional
problems).
