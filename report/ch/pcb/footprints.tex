\section {Footprints}
Some of the components we chose didn't have footprints readily available,
which meant we either had to look for them on the internet, or create some
ourselves.

(TODO: Reference data-sheets for the foot-prints)

\subsection {We made the following footprints ourselves}
\begin {itemize}
\item SD-card
\item VGA-plugg
\item Memory (TSOP54/TSOP44)
\end {itemize}

\subsection {Footprints from Festina Lente:}
As Festina Lente used some components that we also ended up using, we decided,
after talking to Gunnar, to use their Footprints (as they were known good) for these
components:
\begin {itemize}
\item Button
\item USB
\item PowerConnector
\item Crystal
\item Oscillator
The oscillator had one issue last year, namely that the footprint was mirrored,
noting this from Festina Lente's report, we read through the datasheet (REFERENCE),
and remapped the pin-numbering on the foot-print before using this footprint.
\end {itemize}
Molex?
VGA-module?
