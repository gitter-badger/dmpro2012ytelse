\section{SIMD Instruction Set}\label{apx:simd-instruction-set}

SIMD nodes operates on a {\tt 24 bit} instruction set divided in 2 main
formats. Arithmetic instructions (R, I and S) and message passing instructions
(M-send, M-store and M-forward).  \NOTE{Split this up into instruction set and
  assembler section?}

\subsection[R Format]{R Format (OP = 000)}
Arithmetic register functions instructions

\input{fig/fpga/ar-re-fu-in}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ctrl} must be set to 0 in order to be executed on the SIMD node.
\item {\tt mask} is set to 1 to selectively enable the node when executing
  conditional branches.
\item {\tt op} the instruction opcode.
\item {\tt rs} write data register address.
\item {\tt rt} read data 1 register address.
\item {\tt rd} read data 2 register address.
\item {\tt n/a} not assigned for R instructions.
\item {\tt fn} the artimetic operation to perform.
\end{itemize}

\input{fig/fpga/r-instructions}

\subsection[I Format]{I Format (OP = 001)}
Immediate functions using constants.

\input{fig/fpga/immediate-fn-const}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ctrl} must be set to 0 in order to be executed on the SIMD node.
\item {\tt mask} is set to 1 for selectively enabling the node when executing
  conditional branches.
\item {\tt op} the instruction opcode.
\item {\tt rs} write data register address.
\item {\tt rt} read data 1 register address.
\item {\tt const} constant value | immediate.
\item {\tt fn} the artimetic operation to perform.
\end{itemize}

\input{fig/fpga/i-instructions}

\subsection[S Format]{S Format (OP = 010)}
Swap source data register with processed data and store new source data in
register.

\input{fig/fpga/s-fmt-instr}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ctrl} must be set to 0 in order to be executed on the SIMD node.
\item {\tt mask} set to 1 for selectively enabling the node when executing
  conditional branches.
\item {\tt op} the instruction opcode.
\item {\tt rs} new source data register address.
\item {\tt rt} old source data register address.
\item {\tt rd} must be 000000.
\item {\tt n/a} not assigned for S instructions.
\item {\tt fn} must be 000.
\end{itemize}

\input{fig/fpga/s-instructions}

\subsection[M Format]{M Format (OP = 100, 101, 110)}
Send, receive and forward data from and to neighbor nodes in all directions
(north, south, east and west).

\input{fig/fpga/m-fmt-instr}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ctrl} must be set to 0 in order to be executed on the SIMD node.
\item {\tt mask} set to 1 for selectively enabling the node when executing
  conditional branches.
\item {\tt op} the instruction opcode.
\item {\tt n} north data write or read register address.
\item {\tt s} south data write or read register address.
\item {\tt e} east data write or read register address.
\item {\tt w} west data write or read register address.
\item {\tt n/a} no ALU operations applicable.
\end{itemize}

\input{fig/fpga/m-instructions}

In table \ref{tab:m-instructions} we see the different \TODO{Something's amiss
  here} \ldots. \thx{store \& forward} forwards according to the 4-way data
exchange patterns (N $\rightarrow$ E, E $\rightarrow$ S, S $\rightarrow$ W, W
$\rightarrow$ N).

M-instructions must be issued with mask bit set to 0 in order to get data from
all the nodes. Otherwise, one will only get proper data from the ones executing
within a conditional branch. \CHECK{Should this be in an appendix, or?}
