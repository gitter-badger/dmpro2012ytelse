\section{LENA Screenshots}

In this section we show screen shots from the system running several
different image processing algorithms. The image used for the examples
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lenna_unprocessed}. This figure shows a
screen shot when the system runs a simple \emph{show image/video}
program.

Figure \ref{fig:lenna_negated} shows the image after it has had its
colors negated by a program. Figure \ref{fig:lenna_embossed} shows the
image after being run through an embossing algorithm. In Figure
\ref{fig:lenna_edge_detected}, the image has been run through an edge
detection filter.

The images in these examples have all been processed by the cores in the
SIMD array.
