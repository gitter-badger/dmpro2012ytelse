\section{Process}
When we first started working on the \ac{SCU} we focused mostly on the hardware mappings as this was needed for the \ac{PCB} to be delivered. We made sure to make it as similar as possible to the EVK1100 test card which we had avaliable. This made it possible for us to begin writing and testing some of our code before the \ac{PCB} arrived. Having completed this we were able to start thinking about the code and to define what we figured we would need in terms of functions and headers for our application. Granted this was not set in stone as much of the design was yet to be determined, but it gave us a starting point to which we were able to work and improve upon.

Even though a lot of the code could be tested on the test card, some was written without the possibility of testing. Especially the code for communicating with \ac{LENA} was written with crossed fingers far before it could be tested. Because of this, there would be a lot of changes in the code in the final stages of the project. This was, however, as expected.
