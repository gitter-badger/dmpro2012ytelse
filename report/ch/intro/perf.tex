\section{Focus on performance}

Because the assignment task of image processing was combined with a
focus on performance, we decided early on that we wanted our system to
be able to process \emph{video}.

After estimating what kind of demands various video qualities would
place on our system, we decided on aiming for $320\times240$ pixel
resolution, 8 bit grayscale video at 10 frames per second. This would
require a data transfer rate of about 768 kB per second throughout our
system. Given an FPGA design clocked at for example 25 MHz, we would
have about 30 cycles available to process each pixel. All of this seemed
like reasonable yet challenging constraints.
