\section {Schematics}

We decided to design the entire PCB in one schematic, because having read
the Festina Lente report, we noticed that they mention that using multiple schematics
might give some interesting issues (which we never got any further into,
as we never tried to use more than one schematic).

The overall layout of the schematic is logically grouped \"geographically\", to
allow for easy reading of the schematic.
