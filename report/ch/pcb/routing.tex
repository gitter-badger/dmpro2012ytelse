\subsection {Routing}
\input{fig/pcb/routing}
Our plan was to start with a big PCB document to be able to easily place all the components. We placed the components and started routing. A lot of the routing was done by the auto route feature of Altium. At first, we did not set any Design Rules. We found that the default rules did not comply with capabilities listed on Elprints' webpage.\footnote {\url{http://www.elprint.no/products/pcb/capabilities}}. After fixing this, we shrank the board size. The main reason was to reduce production cost, but Tufte also told us that having the board too big could cause short circuits between the power planes.

We then remapped some pins in the schematic to increase physical proximity, and to untangle the amount of crossing wires. Although care was taken during this process, we accidentally managed to disconnect one pin in the schematic while reordering. We did notice this before production, and were able to correct the mistake by manually routing the connection.

In the end, we did 2 days of manual routing to reduce the number of vias. Figure \ref{fig:removingvias-pcb} shows an example where we coupled together several pins to the same via going to the ground layer. Even though we wanted to reduce the number of vias, we went with the default routing in Altium. The amount of manual work could perhaps have been reduced by selecting the "Via Mixer" strategy instead. \TODO{Discussion, not process?}
