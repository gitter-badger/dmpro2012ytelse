{\sc TODO: \color{red} Mention clock rate and possibly the reason for choosing
  it somewhere}

An overview of the architecture of \ac{LENA} as well as its memory and
communication lines is shown in figure \ref{fig:fpga-architecture}. The data
flows mostly through it in one direction. Data is received from the AVR and
stored to the data memory. The data is then read in parts from the data memory
and sent through the \ac{SIMD} array for processing. The result from the
\ac{SIMD} array is stored to the data memory again. \TODO {Say why the DMA 
doesen't send data to both data and VGA ram, yet have to use control core 
instead. (Supposedly because  the output image it's more stable this way?
 )} At last, the data is copied
from the data memory to the \ac{VGA} memory and shown on screen.

The processing part of \ac{LENA} is the \ac{SIMD} array. It is organized in a
matrix as specified by the assignment, and is designed to process images. Each
node processes one word at a time and can communicate with its four direct
neighbors. This makes the architecture \TODO{I replaced processor with
  architecture, but should we say machine instead?} well suited for applying 3x3
image filters, such as the Laplace filter. See Appendix \ref{apx:laplace} for an
implementation.

To first load the data into the \ac{SIMD} array, it is sent to the first column
of the nodes and copied to the right, passing through all the nodes until the
last column.  This is done by using a special register for sending data, called
the S register\TODO{First time S register is introduced.}. Data is continuously
received by the first column, so the whole array is filled. At that time, data
processing can start. The data is swapped onto another register of the node, and
new data can be loaded through the S register.  When both data processing and
transmission of new data is done, the registers are swapped again. At this
point, we have results in the S registers and can send this out to the right
while loading new data from the left. The results are copied out of the array
from the last column.

Data communication between AVR, the \ac{SIMD} nodes and the \ac{VGA}
controller is handled by the control module which communicates with the data-
and program memory, and keeps track of the data location on these. The control
module sends instructions to all of the \ac{SIMD} nodes and is responsible for
splitting the data and loading it into the \ac{SIMD} array in correct order by
setting the S registers of the first column. It also retrieves the results from
the last column of the array and stores it to the data memory.

The \ac{FPGA} receives data from the AVR on 24 input lines. This is enough to
transmit one instruction per transmission. All of the instructions are copied
into the instruction memory before any other data is sent. The image data is
sent one word (8 bits) at a time. We considered using all 24 lines for data
transmission, but as we tested the transmission rate, we realized that it was
fast enough by only sending one word at a time. This was easier to
implement and was therefore the chosen implementation.

The \ac{SIMD} array is created dynamically in \ac{VHDL}, hence the number of
cores is easily interchangeable. The final number of cores in our implementation
is only limited by the available space on the \ac{FPGA}. We tried to fit as many
nodes as possible, and the \ac{FPGA} we used had enough space for 6 nodes.
\TODO{Jahre vil at det skal komme bedre fram at dette ikke er noe vi kan gjøre noe med, med strek under "the FPGA we used".
Nevnte i diskusjon om non-functional requirements at dette ikke er noe vi kan gjøre noe med, er det nok?}
