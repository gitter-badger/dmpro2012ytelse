\section{Performance}


In this section, there will be data as specified in the disposition. We will run
a program which requires data from neighbors, and see how long time the
different programs take based on the amount of cores. We will then explain
eventual results | for instance would the results most likely point out that we
have low latency, and that it will take a very short amount of time to get data
from neighbors.

There will also be some fancy plots and tables here to show the decrease in time
and/or the increase in speedup.
