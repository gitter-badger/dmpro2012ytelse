\section {Power supply}

After talking to Tufte and Jahre, we ended up with cribbing the power supply
from Festina Lente completely. Tufte said the power supply had evolved year by
year, and would therefore be a better solution than trying to create one from
scratch ourselves. By doing so, we reduced the possibility for additional
problems.
