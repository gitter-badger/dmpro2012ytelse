\section{SIMD-nodes}

All SIMD nodes shares the same instruction set and execute instructions in
parlell. {\tt Word} size is 8 bit. Each SIMD node is fully equipped with
registers, aritmetic logic unit (ALU), message passing and instruction handling
through the SIMD Node instruction set detailed in this page.

The schematic of a SIMD node is shown in figure
\ref{fig:fpga-simd-arch}. \TODO{Talk around the figure}

\input{fig/fpga/fpga-simd-arch}

\subsection{Components}
In order to the keep the signals to a minimum, the simd node is nicely divieded
into seperate components which makes up the datapath for the node.

\subsection{Instruction Decoder}
This is the node's control component. It takes the OP-code of the instruction
and sets control signals for all the other components in the node.

\subsection{I/O Controller}

\subsection{Register Bank}

\subsection{ALU}

\subsection{S Register}
The S REG (source data register) is a special purpose register within the SIMD
node and holds the next source data for the node. It is partly controlled by the
node's instruction set and partly controlleb by a special {\tt step} signal form
the DMA.

This register also has the capability to recieve data from the left node,
through the {\tt s\_in}-bus, and passing it along to node on the right through
the {\tt s\_out}-bus when instructed by the {\tt step} singal. This allows a
suimultanious data transfer while the node is busy processing.

Rising the value on the {\tt swap} control signal will write the result from the
ALU to the S\_REG and compy the data from the S\_REG out to the {\tt s\_new}
bus, ultimatly writing this data to the register bank.

\subsection{State Register}

\subsection{Registers}
Each SIMD node have $2^4$ general purpose registers. 4 of these are avaiable for
general storage when executing instructions. The remaining 2 registers are the
special purpose registers {\tt \$zero} and {\tt \$state}.

\input{fig/fpga/simd-registers}

\subsection{State-register}

\subsection{Zero-register}

\subsection{BRAM and SRAM}
Block RAM (BRAM) or Static RAM (SRAM) are not available form the SIMD node.

\subsection{Instruction Set}
SIMD nodes operates on an {\tt 24 bit} instruction set divided into 2 main
formats. Arithmetic instructions (R, I and S) and message passing instructions
(M-send, M-store and M-forward).

\subsection{Ideology}

\subsection{R-Format (OP = 000)}
Arithmetic register functions instructions

\input{fig/fpga/ar-re-fu-in}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ctrl} must be set to 0 in order to be executed on the SIMD node.
\item {\tt mask} is set to 1 for selectively enabling the node when executing
  conditional branches.
\item {\tt op} this is the instruction op-code.
\item {\tt rs} write data register address.
\item {\tt rt} read data 1 register address.
\item {\tt rd} read data 2 register address.
\item {\tt n/a} not assigned for R-instructions.
\item {\tt fn} is the artimetic operation to perform.
\end{itemize}

\input{fig/fpga/r-instructions}

\subsection{I-Format (OP = 001)}
Immediate functions using constants.

\input{fig/fpga/immediate-fn-const}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ctrl} must be set to 0 in order to be executed on the SIMD node.
\item {\tt mask} is set to 1 for selectivly enabling the node when executing
  conditional branches.
\item {\tt op} this is the instruction op-code.
\item {\tt rs} write data register address.
\item {\tt rt} read data 1 register address.
\item {\tt const} constant value (immediate).
\item {\tt fn} is the artimetic operation to perform.
\end{itemize}

\input{fig/fpga/i-instructions}

\subsection{S-Format (OP = 010)}
Swap source data register with processed data and store new source data in
register.

\input{fig/fpga/s-fmt-instr}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ctrl}  must be set to 0 in order to be executed on the SIMD node.
\item {\tt mask} is set to 1 for selectivly enabling the node when executing
  conditional branches.
\item {\tt op}   this is the instruction op-code.
\item {\tt rs}   new source data register address.
\item {\tt rt}   old source data register adddress.
\item {\tt rd}   must be 000000.
\item {\tt n/a}  not assigned for S-instructions.
\item {\tt fn}   must be 000.
\end{itemize}

\input{fig/fpga/s-instructions}

\subsection{M-Format (OP = 100, 101, 110)}
Send, recieve and forward data from and to neighbour nodes in all directions (north, south, east and west).

\input{fig/fpga/m-fmt-instr}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt ctrl} must be set to 0 in order to be executed on the SIMD node.
\item {\tt mask} is set to 1 for selectivly enabling the node when executing
  conditional branches.
\item {\tt op} this is the instruction op-code.
\item {\tt n} north data write or read register address.
\item {\tt s} south data write or read register address.
\item {\tt e} east data write or read register address.
\item {\tt w} west data write or read register address.
\item {\tt n/a} no ALU operations applicable.
\end{itemize}

\input{fig/fpga/m-instructions}

In figure \ref{tab:m-instructions} we see the different \ldots.  \thx{store \&
  forward} forwards according to the 4-way data exchange patterns (N
$\rightarrow$ E, E $\rightarrow$ S, S $\rightarrow$ W, W $\rightarrow$ N).

{\tt PRO TIP} \TODO{Better avoid calling it PRO TIP in the report}
M-instruction, especially send and forwards, must be issued with mask bit set to
0 in order to get data from all the nodes and not only those withich are
execuriting withing a conditional branch (status = 1).

\input{fig/fpga/fpga-simd-datacom}\TODO{Split up into 3 figures instead?}


\subsection{Branching}
Since all nodes run the same instructions, both parts of a branch must be
executed. Nodes are setting the {\tt state} to 1 in order to indicate that they
are executing within that part of the branch.

\input{fig/fpga/single-level-branching}

\subsection{Multi-level branching}
Since state register is 8 it is possible to have up-to 8 nested branches by
shifting the current state to the left and adding the new state to the
end. Below \TODO{Refer to table, not relative to where it is placed} are the
instructions for performing a multilevel-branch.

\input{fig/fpga/multi-level-branching}
\CHECK{Could any of these tables be figures instead?}
