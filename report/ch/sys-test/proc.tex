\section{Test Procedures}

Some of these tests are strictly dependent on other tests. In theory, all the
different tests could be done in any order to test the correctness of the
system. However, some of the functional requirements makes it easy to test other
functional requirements. Therefore, we have decided to let some of these tests
have dependencies. In addition, their ordering is a natural way to approach and
test such a system, mostly because some of the test have a slight overlap. For
instance, it is easier to have example programs if the assembler works
correctly.

{\sc Test 1 - Functional Requirement 5}

{\em \FRV}

Write a \ac{SCU} program to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Activate \acp{LED}.
\item Wait a specified amount of time.
\item Deactivate leds.
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 2 - Functional Requirement 4}

{\em \FRIV}

Write a \ac{SCU} program to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set up button interrupts.
\item Flip led X when button X is pressed.
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 3 - Functional Requirement 6}

{\em \FRVI}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 4 - Functional Requirement 3}

{\em \FRIII}

Write a \ac{SCU} program to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load the \ac{LENA} with a program that just copies an image out to the
  \ac{VGA}.
\item Read an image from the \ac{SD} card.
\item Load the image onto the \ac{LENA}.
\item Start the \ac{LENA}.
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 5 - Functional Requirement 7}

{\em \FRVII}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 6 - Functional Requirement 1}

{\em \FRI}

Write an \ac{SCU} program to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load the \ac{LENA} with a program that copies images out to the \ac{VGA}
  as they are loaded.
\item Read an image from the \ac{SD} card.
\item Load the image onto the \ac{LENA}.
\item Start the \ac{LENA}.
\item Repeat stage 2 to 4 until we are out of pictures.
\item Measure speed.
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 7 - Functional Requirement 2}

{\em \FRII}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}
