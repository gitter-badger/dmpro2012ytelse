\section {Routing}

We spent the entire final week before production working on the routing,
the reason for the time span needed for this was a result of a couple of
things.

(TODO: Expand the following into text)
\begin {itemize}
\item We were the first group to start routing, and thus got to fall into all the gotcha-traps that
exist for routing, with no-one to walk into them ahead of us.
\item We didn't think about physical proximity when laying out the pins
\item We had 5 memory chips, with all the extra connections that implies.
\item We didn't set limitations until a few days into the week.
\end {itemize}

In the end we remapped some pins to increase physical proximity, and to untangle the
amount of crossing wires. Finally we did some manual routing to reduce the amount of
unneccessary vias.
