\section {Process}
This section describes the work and design challenges faced related to the PCB.
\subsection{Memory}
As discussed earlier, as one of our earliest design choices we chose 3 separate memories to allow overlap of
memory accesses. Since the requirements for the data/instruction memories differed in both size and word-width 
we wound up with not only separate, but also different chips for this purpose. The same choice meant we also
needed a separate memory for our \ac{VGA} controller, as that needed to read it's buffer as fast as possible
without interfering with the speed of the rest of the system. This called for a memory that was big enough to
hold atleast a full screen-frame, at 8-bit per pixel (since each pixel is an 8-bit greyscale pixel).

To reduce the possibility of having too slow data-access from the AVR, an extra memory was added to work as
a buffer for the AVR as well. This design choice was made {\em after} ordering, which meant that we had to choose from
the chips we had already ordered to fit this purpose. Since this was intended to carry data intended for the rest
of the system, and as the rest of the system is working with data in 8-bit bytes, we ended up using one of the
extra chips ordered as \ac{VGA} memory for this purpose.

\subsection{Soldering}
After that we started soldering the AVR. Getting the AVR in place was particularly difficult,
but after asking Tufte, we lent a glue stick to put some glue on. The increased friction helped keeping the AVR in place during soldering.

After about a days work we managed to completely destroy a pin on the AVR,
therefore we had to start from scratch on a new board. On this new board we
started with the AVR and \ac{FPGA}, as they were the hardest components to
solder. After each side on the AVR and \ac{FPGA}, we tested for short
circuits. As none were found, we moved on to the power supply, as well as
\acp{JTAG}, FLASH and \acp{LED}. In order to check the \ac{PCB} was working, the
AVR and \ac{FPGA} groups tested the \ac{PCB} board without the capacitors, after
both groups tested that they could connect to the AVR and \ac{FPGA}
respectively, we began to solder the rest part of the \ac{PCB}.
