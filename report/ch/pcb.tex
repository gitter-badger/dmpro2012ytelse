The entire system is connected together on the PCB. Designing and soldering
a correct and working PCB is thus important to be able to construct the system
as a whole.

This chapter will start by explaining how some of our overall design choices
affected the PCB design, we then explain our power-layout before giving an
overview of where we got our footprints from. We then go through how the PCB
was tested. Finally we explain the process of making the PCB, as well as some
of the issues and solutions we met during the process.
