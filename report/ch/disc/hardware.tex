\section {Hardware}

As we decided to use many of the same solutions as privious years, we also decided to use many of the same components, as it was proven to work. Following the same logic, some of our solutions are more or less a copy of privious years, such as the power supply. This is because we were havily advised to use working solutions if we found them, and the power suplly for instance, was "worked on and perfectionized over multiple years" as Gunnar said. We always tried to double check and find out how they worked before creating a new part in our system. When we came to the serial, our multiple sources seemingly disagreed with how festina lente had theirs. We chose to do it the other way, which turned out to not work quite as well as we hoped.
\TODO {Find out wether serial works or not}
