\section {PCB testing}

\input{fig/pcb/pcbwithoutcomp}

When the \ac{PCB} arrived from production, the soldering proved
to be a bit more difficult than originally anticipated.
First, we tested whether
there were any short circuits in the board itself. We used the multimeter to test that
there was no current passing from one layer to another. Then, we started to solder the power supply, one power plane at time, testing the board for short
circuit after each iteration. The table \ref{fig:pcb} shows the observed voltage from each plane.
