\section{Power}

In this section, there will be data as specified in the disposition. We will run
a program which requires data from neighbours, and see how much power the
different programs take based on the amount of cores. We will then explain
eventual results. Compared to the other group, we have completely ignored power
consumption, and e.g. our voltage regulators (?) just burn off the additional
power they get, so it's likely a drastic difference here.

There will also be some fancy plots and tables here to show the (incredibly
high) power consumption.
