When designing a system aimed for performance, one have to test the system and
compare it to other solutions to see whether we have gained any mentionable
speedup. As the assignment was to create an array-based image processor, it
would be interesting to see how much more efficient our design is, depending on
the amount of cores the system has.

The first section will go in detail on the performance aspect of the results. We
will here look at throughput, total processing time and other aspects related to
performance, and compare them based on the number of cores we use. In the
following section, we will have a look at the power consumption. We will measure
how much power the system requires running with different cores, and how much
power the system requires to process a single task with different amount of
cores.

\TODO{Some summary section where we compare our results with the other group
  would be interesting.}
