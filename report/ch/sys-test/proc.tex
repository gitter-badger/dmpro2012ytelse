\section{Test Procedures}

Some of these tests are strictly dependent on other. In theory, all the
different tests could be done in any order to test the correctness of the
system. However, some of the functional requirements makes it easy to test other
functional requirements. Therefore, we have decided to let some of these tests
have dependencies. In addition, their ordering is a natural way to approach and
test such a system, mostly because some of the test have a slight overlap. For
instance, it is easier to have example programs if the assembler works
correctly.

{\sc Test 1 - Functional Requirement 5}

{\em The machine should have on-board LEDs for visual feedback.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 2 - Functional Requirement 4}

{\em It should be possible to operate the machine with on-board buttons.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 3 - Functional Requirement 6}

{\em There should be developer tools (assembler) available for the machine.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 4 - Functional Requirement 3}

{\em The machine should have a video port for image output.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 5 - Functional Requirement 7}

{\em The machine should have example programs demonstrating its capabilities,
  such as a video player and a median filter.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 6 - Functional Requirement 1}

{\em The image processor should be fast enough to output unmodified 8-bit
  images of at least $320\times240$ resolution at 10 frames per second.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}

{\sc Test 7 - Functional Requirement }

{\em The image processor should be generally programmable.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Foo
\item Baz
\item Spam
\item Egg
\end{enumerate}
