\section {The PCB}

When the PCB finally arrived from production we started soldering, this proved to be a bit
more difficult than originally anticipated. Getting the AVR in place was particularly difficult,
but after asking Gunnar we were lent a "limstift" to put some glue on it to improve friction, and
thus avoid it moving away the instant we came close with the solder iron.

After about a days work we managed to destroy a pin on the AVR, and thus had to redo completely on
a new board. Having learnt a few lessons from the first round of soldering the second round went without
issues.

TODO: Add some information about testing.
