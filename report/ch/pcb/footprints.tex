\section {Footprints}
Some of the components we chose didn't have footprints readily available,
which meant we either had to look for them on the internet, or create some
ourselves.

This usually meant either staring at datasheets and carefully placing pins relative
to each other, or running the IPC-wizard.

\subsection {We made the following footprints ourselves}
(TODO: Make the links into references)
\begin {itemize}
\item SD-card \url{http://katalog.we-online.de/em/datasheet/693063010911.pdf}
With the pin-designations selected by googling the pinouts for SD-cards in general, and
comparing a few of those hits to make sure that the results agreed \url{http://pinouts.ru/Memory/sdcard_pinout.shtml}
ended up being what we based the schematic-component based on. (Mention that this was
particularly hard to decipher from the datasheet, and that we did need to ask Gunnar for
help atleast once, just to read the datasheet?)
\item VGA-plugg \url{http://www.te.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=srchrtrv&DocNm=82068_AMPLIMITE_Right-Angle_Posted_Conn&DocType=Catalog+Section&DocLang=English&PartCntxt=}
\item Memory (TSOP54/TSOP44)
TODO: Fill in a bit about the wizard used to generate this:
The TSOP54/TSOP44 footprints were created using the IPC Footprint Wizard, as their datasheets fitted
nicely with the Small Outline Package-setting in that Wizard.

Data-memory (2M x 8bit) CY7C1069DV33  54TSOP: \url{http://www.cypress.com/?docID=31945}
Program-memory (64K x 16bit) CY7C1021DV33  44TSOP: \url{http://www.cypress.com/?docID=31965}
VGA memory (512 x 8bit) CY7C1049DV33 TSOP44 : \url{http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1468461.pdf}
\end {itemize}

\subsection {Footprints from Festina Lente:}
As Festina Lente used some components that we also ended up using, we decided,
after talking to Gunnar, to use their Footprints (as they were known good) for these
components:
\url{http://org.ntnu.no/datamaskinerprosjekt2011/altium_libraries/dmprolibrary/}
\begin {itemize}
\item Button
\item Crystal
\item USB
\item Oscillator
The oscillator had one issue last year, namely that the footprint was mirrored,
noting this from Festina Lente's report, we read through the datasheet (REFERENCE),
and remapped the pin-numbering on the foot-print before using this footprint.
\item PowerConnector
\item VGA-module
\end {itemize}
Molex? (Still in the project, but wasn't used, but double-check this)

In addition we used the following premade footprints:
\begin {itemize}
\item AVR-footprint - from AVR-freaks.
\item FPGA-footprint - Built-in from the Altium Designer Library.
\end {itemize}

TODO: Mention the 1206-es that we chose to use based on the Festina Lente-report
