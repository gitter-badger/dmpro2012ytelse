\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conc}

\begin{flushright}{\slshape
    In which a conclusion is reached\\
    where ideas and theories\\
    peeks on reality
}
\end{flushright}

This part seems relatively straightforward, and will be written in the
not-to-distant future.

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item If we removed the special ``Get all 4 neighbour values at
  once''-instructions and other special parts of the system, would we be able to
  get more cores?
\item If we strip the SIMD nodes almost to the bone, barely being turing
  complete, how many nodes would we get?
\end{itemize}
