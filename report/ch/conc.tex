\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item If we removed the special ``Get all 4 neighbor values at
  once''-instructions and other special parts of the system, would we be able to
  get more cores?
\item If we strip the \ac{SIMD} nodes almost to the bone, barely being Turing
  complete, how many nodes would we get?
\end{itemize}
