\section {Power supply}

After talking to Gunnar and Magnus, we ended up with cribbing the power supply
from Festina Lente completely. Gunnar said the power supply had evolved year by
year, and would therefore be a better solution than trying to create one from
scratch ourselves. By doing so, we reduced the possibility for additional
problems.
