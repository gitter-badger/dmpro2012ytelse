\subsection{Soldering}
After about a days work we managed to completely destroy a pin on the AVR,
therefore we had to start from scratch on a new board. On this new board we
started with the AVR and \ac{FPGA}, as they were the hardest components to
solder. After each side on the AVR and \ac{FPGA}, we tested for short
circuits. As none were found, we moved on to the power supply, as well as
\acp{JTAG}, FLASH and \acp{LED}. In order to check that the \ac{PCB} was working, the
AVR and \ac{FPGA} groups tested the \ac{PCB} board without the capacitors, after
both groups tested that they could connect to the AVR and \ac{FPGA}
respectively, we began to solder the rest of the \ac{PCB}.
