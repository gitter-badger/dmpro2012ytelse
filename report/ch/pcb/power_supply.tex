\section {Power Supply}
\input{fig/pcb/pcb_powersoldered}
After talking to Tufte and Jahre, we decided to reuse the power supply
from Festina Lente without any changes. Tufte said the power supply had evolved year by
year, and that it would therefore be a better solution to reuse it rather
than trying to create one from scratch. By doing so, we reduced the possibility 
of introducing new issues.
