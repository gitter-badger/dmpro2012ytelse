\section {Hardware}

As we decided to use many of the same solutions as previous years, we naturally
decided to use many of the same components as they were proven to
work. Following the same logic, some of our solutions are more or less a copy of
previous years, such as the power supply. This is because we were heavily
advised to use working solutions if we found any. \CHECK{Examples are fire, but
  I don't think this is relevant?} As the instance with the power supply, which
was ``worked on and perfected over multiple years'' as Tufte said. We always
tried to double check and find out how they worked before creating a new part in
our system. When we came to the serial, multiple sources seemingly disagreed
with how Festina Lente had theirs\TODO{Bad sentence. Cleanup}. We chose to do it
the other way\TODO{What other way?}, which turned out to not work quite as well
as we hoped.
