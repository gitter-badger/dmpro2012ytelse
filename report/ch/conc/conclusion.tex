\section{Conclusion}

We managed to design and implement an image processor capable of handling simple
video in real time. The final system meets all the functional and non-functional
requirements laid down at the beginning of the project. We fulfilled the given
assignment, as well as our own goals for the project.

Our goal of a frame rate of at least 10 fps was of particular importance. This
goal was intended to keep us focused on the performance part of the
assignment. The final system plays video at up to 13 frames per second, even when
performing tasks such as edge detection.

We did not expect that the SD card would be a bottleneck in our system. However,
when this turned out to be the case, it was fortunate that we were able to
mitigate this by putting effort into optimizing the code.

Although our system achieves our goals, there are certainly areas left for
further exploration. Some examples of this are detailed in the next section.

This project has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences
during our endeavours into computer science. Given our limited previous
experience in the area of hardware design, we are thrilled to have accomplished
as much as we have.
