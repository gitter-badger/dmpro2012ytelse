\section{Introduction}

We have named our processor LENA (Lightweight, Efficient Node Array) and it is
implemented on the FPGA. It's main components are a SIMD array consising of 4
cores, a control module to manage the data, and a VGA controller. LENA is
responsible for receiving data from the AVR, processing it and sending the
output to the VGA port.
